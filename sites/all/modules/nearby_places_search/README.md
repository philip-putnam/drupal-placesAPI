2. Copy the 'nearby_places_search' module directory in to your Drupal 
'sites/all/modules' directory and install it as usual.

3. Download the places marker images library from 
https://github.com/ashwinshaharkar/nearbyplace.markers.library

4. Unzip the file and rename the folder to "nearby_places_search.markers" 
(pay attention to the case of the letters)

5. Put the folder in a libraries directory
   Ex: sites/all/libraries

6. Ensure you have a valid path similar to this one for all files
   Ex: sites/all/libraries/nearby_places_search.markers

That's it!

Usage
=====
1. In path (admin/config/content/place-types) configure the search settings for 
places. 

2. You can change the type of place, the center point and the radius from the 
center point in the configuration page.

3. In path (admin/structure/block) find and configure the 'Nearby Place Search' 
block as per requirement.
e.g. Block title : Nearby Place Search, etc

Note: As this block covers most of the page space so we cannot assign this block
into smaller regions e.g Siderbar first or Siderbar second region. 
We must assign it into main contain or similar regions.
